# Assignment1: Getting Organized

# Overview

The purpose of this document is to demonstrate the process of breaking down the work and gathering necessary information before an initial client meeting. The client, a Pet Daycare business, has expressed frustration with both the employee and client onboarding processes. This document outlines our assumptions, requirements breakdown, clarification questions, and preliminary tasks to address these issues.

# Assumptions
Before the meeting, the following assumptions have been made based on preliminary interviews and stakeholder feedback:
1.	It's assumed that reducing the onboarding time for new employees from 3 months to a shorter period (e.g., 1 month) is feasible with process improvements.
2.	It is anticipated that there is currently no standardized process for onboarding contemporary clients, and that each employee has their own approach.
3.	It is also anticipated that the complexity and irregularity of the onboarding process are the main causes of the dissatisfaction expressed by clients and representatives.
4.	The client is anticipated to be receptive to using contemporary tools and innovation to expedite the onboarding process for both clients and employees.
5.	It's assumed that employees are willing to participate in training programs to learn and adopt the new standardized onboarding process.
6.	It's assumed that the client is willing to implement a system for collecting feedback from employees and customers to continuously improve the onboarding process.
7.	It's assumed that there will be clear and open communication channels between the project team and the client to address any issues or concerns promptly.
